Absolutely, let’s sketch that out! We can imagine the AskNewton “Society of Mind” as a collection of specialized AI agents, each playing a particular role in the health insurance workflow.

AskNewton “Society of Mind” Architecture

1. The Onboarding Agent
This agent handles user registration and the initial intake of customer data. Think of it as the friendly front door that gathers basic information, verifies identities, and makes sure the user is set up in the system.

2. The Coverage Advisor Agent
Once a user is onboarded, this agent helps them figure out which health plans or coverage options make the most sense. It might use reasoning models to recommend plans based on the user’s needs, budget, and any specific health conditions they’ve mentioned.

3. The Claims Helper Agent
This agent is all about making the claims process smoother. It can guide users through submitting a claim, checking the status, and even explaining the details of reimbursements. This is where some of those more specialized reasoning models or even document-understanding tools might come into play.

4. The Customer Service Agent
This one acts like a virtual concierge. It’s the agent that handles everyday questions, policy changes, or just provides a friendly chat interface for users who need help. This is probably where the OpenAI language model piece comes in, offering natural and engaging responses.

Product Roadmap Overview

Phase 1: MVP Development
	•	Start by building out the Onboarding and Customer Service agents as core components. Use Replit for rapid iteration and integrate OpenAI models for natural language interactions.

Phase 2: Expand Coverage Advisor and Claims Helper
	•	Once the basics are in place, develop the Coverage Advisor agent to offer personalized plan recommendations. Also, bring in the Claims Helper to streamline the claims submission and tracking process.

Phase 3: Refinement and Integration
	•	Finally, refine the interactions between these agents and integrate them into a cohesive user experience. You can start layering in more advanced reasoning models or domain-specific tools to handle more complex scenarios as you grow.

And there you have it! This way, you’re basically building out a little ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each with its own job, all contributing to a fully functional health insurance company experience.
