I can’t fetch keys from your account (I can’t access your Replit or any other accounts), but I can show you exactly where to *look* and how to create/manage them safely. Follow the steps below depending on which “key” you need — an **account API token** (for Replit REST/API access) or a **per-Repl secret** (environment variable used inside a specific Repl).

---

# 1) Find / create an **Account API Token** (Replit account-level token)

Use this when you need a token to call Replit’s API (or third-party scripts that integrate with your Replit account).

1. Sign in to [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) with your account.
2. Click your avatar (top-right) → **Account** (or **Settings** / **Profile settings**).
3. Look for a section labelled **API tokens**, **Developer**, **Personal access tokens**, or **Secrets & tokens**.
4. If you don’t have one yet, click **Create new token** (or similar). Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `asknewton-replit-integration`) and create it.
5. **Copy the token immediately** and store it in a secure place (you’ll usually only see it once).
6. If you suspect a token is compromised, revoke/rotate it in the same screen.

Notes: token names and exact labels vary slightly across UI versions — if you don’t see “API tokens” check Account → Developer or Security sections.

# 2) Add / find **Repl-level secrets** (env vars used inside a project)

Use these when your code in a Repl needs an API key (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Stripe, etc.) without committing it to source.

1. Open the Repl (the project) in the Replit editor.
2. On the left sidebar look for the lock icon or a section labelled **Secrets**, **Secrets (Environment variables)**, or **Environment**.
3. Click **Add secret** (or the +).
4. Enter the KEY name (e.g., `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) and the VALUE (paste the token). Save.
5. In your code reference `process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (Node) or `os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"]` (Python) — Replit will inject it at runtime.
6. To view or change, use the same Secrets UI. Replit won’t display the value in plaintext after initial save (only masked).

# 3) Replit Teams / Organization tokens

If you’re using Replit Teams / Enterprise, tokens and secrets may be in **Team settings** or a team-level secrets area — ask the team owner or check Team → Settings → Secrets.

---

# 4) Optional: CLI / Automation (advanced)

You can manage secrets programmatically with Replit’s CLI/automation tools if you use them. Check Replit docs for the current `replit` CLI commands (login, secrets add/list). Don’t run CLI commands that you don’t understand — let me draft safe examples if you want.

---

# 5) How to use a token securely (example snippets)

Node (fetch / fetch-like):

```js
// read token from env (set in Replit Secrets)
const key = process.env.REPLIT_API_TOKEN;
await fetch("https://api.replit.com/...", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${key}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({/*...*/})
});
```

Python (requests):

```py
import os, requests
key = os.environ.get("REPLIT_API_TOKEN")
resp = requests.get("https://api.replit.com/...", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {key}"})
```

Never hardcode tokens in source or commit them to git.

---

# 6) Security best practices

* **Never paste** API keys into chat, public code, or non-private docs.
* Use **per-purpose tokens** (one token per integration) and descriptive names.
* **Restrict scopes** where Replit supports it (create tokens only with the permissions you need).
* **Rotate** tokens periodically and **revoke** any suspected-compromised ones.
* Use Replit **Secrets** for runtime env vars; don’t store secrets in files.
* Consider an external secrets manager (Vault/1Password/AWS Secrets Manager) for production.

---

If you want, I can:

* Draft the exact token name + description you should create (and example scopes).
* Generate the code snippet you’ll paste into a specific Repl (Node / Python / Go).
* Walk you step-by-step while you’re on your screen (tell me which Replit view you see and I’ll guide next click).

Which would you like me to do next?
